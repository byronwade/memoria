# Memoria Integration

Memoria gives AI assistants memory of what broke before. Use these MCP tools to avoid breaking coupled files.

## File Analysis Rule

BEFORE modifying any file, call the `analyze_file` MCP tool:

```json
{"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.ts"}
```

What you get:
- Risk Score (0-100): LOW (0-24), MEDIUM (25-49), HIGH (50-74), CRITICAL (75+)
- Coupled Files: Files that historically change together
- Static Dependents: Files that import this file
- Pre-flight Checklist: Files to verify before committing

Actions based on risk:
- LOW (0-24): Safe to proceed normally
- MEDIUM (25-49): Verify coupled files are still compatible
- HIGH (50-74): Read all coupled files before making changes
- CRITICAL (75+): Stop and ask the user before proceeding

## History Search Rule

Before removing "weird" code, call `ask_history` to understand WHY it exists:

```json
{"query": "setTimeout", "path": "/absolute/path/to/file.ts"}
```

IMPORTANT: Use SHORT keywords (1-3 words). Do NOT use full sentences - git grep requires exact matches.

Parameters:
- query - Short keyword (e.g., "setTimeout", "Safari", "race condition")
- path - Optional: scope to specific file
- searchType - "message", "diff", or "both" (default)
- startLine/endLine - For line-range search (Sherlock Mode)

## Memory Extraction Rule

Use `extract_memories` to find important context from code comments:

```json
{"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.ts"}
```

Scans for CRITICAL, WARNING, HACK, TODO annotations and auto-saves high-confidence ones.

## Get Context Rule

Use `get_context` before modifying a file to get relevant memories:

```json
{"path": "/absolute/path/to/file.ts", "query": "what I'm trying to do"}
```

## Mandatory Rules

1. ALWAYS call `analyze_file` before modifying any code file
2. If risk is CRITICAL: Stop and ask user before proceeding
3. If risk is HIGH: Read all coupled files first
4. Before removing code: Call `ask_history` to check if it's a bug fix
5. Use ABSOLUTE paths (e.g., /Users/name/project/src/file.ts)
6. Use SHORT keywords in `ask_history` queries (not sentences)

## Cloud Features (Optional)

To save memories to your account, run `npx @byronwade/memoria login` in your terminal.
